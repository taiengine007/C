 how **FIFO (First In, First Out) special files** work in terms of inter-process communication (IPC) in Unix-like systems.

### Explanation

1. **FIFO Concept**: 
   A FIFO is essentially a **named pipe** that allows data to flow from one process to another, in a first-in, first-out manner. It behaves like a pipe between processes, where one writes and the other reads. The special thing about FIFO files is that they are **named** and stored in the filesystem, unlike anonymous pipes.

2. **Blocking Behavior**: 
   The key part of the statement explains the **blocking behavior** when interacting with a FIFO. A FIFO is a type of communication channel that requires two processes (or two ends) to be involved:
   
   - One process opens the FIFO for **reading**.
   - Another process opens the FIFO for **writing**.

   **Blocking** means that if a process attempts to perform I/O (input/output) operations on a FIFO, and the opposite end isn't ready to perform its own corresponding I/O, the process will **block** (i.e., it will wait) until the opposite process is ready. Let's break this down:

   - **Reader Blocking**: If a process attempts to **read** from a FIFO and no process has opened the FIFO for writing, the reader process will **block** (wait). This is because the FIFO is empty and the process cannot proceed until there is data to read.
   
   - **Writer Blocking**: Similarly, if a process attempts to **write** to a FIFO and no process has opened the FIFO for reading, the writer process will **block** (wait). This is because there is no process waiting to consume the data, and the FIFO cannot hold data indefinitely without being read.

   In both cases, the process will not proceed until the corresponding opposite process opens the FIFO and is ready to either read or write.

3. **Why Blocking Happens**:
   - **Synchronization**: FIFO ensures synchronization between processes. A process writing data into the FIFO needs to make sure that there is another process ready to read the data; otherwise, the writing process is blocked because there is nowhere for the data to go.
   - Likewise, a process reading data from the FIFO needs to ensure that there is data written to the FIFO first. If no data is available, the reading process is blocked until something is written.

4. **The Process of Opening the FIFO**:
   - When a FIFO is created with `mkfifo()`, it exists as a special file in the filesystem. Processes can then open the FIFO for reading or writing using `open()`.
   - If you open the FIFO for reading and no one has opened it for writing, the call to `open()` will **block** until a writer opens the FIFO.
   - If you open the FIFO for writing and no one has opened it for reading, the call to `open()` will **block** until a reader opens the FIFO.

5. **Simultaneous Opening**:
   - In general, a FIFO is designed to work only when both ends (reader and writer) are opened at the same time, or at least, the operations are coordinated. One process cannot just start writing or reading until the corresponding end of the FIFO is ready.

### Example of Blocking Behavior:
1. **Writer Process**:
   - The writer process opens the FIFO for writing and starts writing data. If no reader is available, the process will block and wait for a reader.
   
2. **Reader Process**:
   - The reader process opens the FIFO for reading. If no writer has written any data, it will block and wait for the writer to write some data.

### Non-blocking Mode:
If you want to avoid blocking, you can open the FIFO with the `O_NONBLOCK` flag. This allows the process to perform non-blocking I/O, meaning it will not wait indefinitely. Instead, if the FIFO is not ready for reading or writing, the operation will fail immediately with an error (e.g., `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`).

### Conclusion:
In summary, the statement describes the **synchronous nature** of FIFO special files. A reader blocks until the writer opens the FIFO, and a writer blocks until the reader opens it. This behavior ensures that data is transmitted correctly between processes, but it also requires synchronization between the writing and reading processes.
