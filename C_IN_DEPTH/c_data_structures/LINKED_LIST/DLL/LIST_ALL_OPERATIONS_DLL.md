# DOUBLE LINKED LIST
---

### **1. Creation**
- **Create a Node**: Allocate memory for a new node and initialize its data, `next`, and `prev` pointers.

---

### **2. Insertion**
- **Insert at the Beginning**: Add a new node at the start of the list and update `head`.
- **Insert at the End**: Add a new node at the end of the list.
- **Insert After a Node**: Insert a new node after a specific node.
- **Insert Before a Node**: Insert a new node before a specific node.

---

### **3. Deletion**
- **Delete at the Beginning**: Remove the first node of the list and update `head`.
- **Delete at the End**: Remove the last node of the list.
- **Delete a Specific Node**: Delete a node with a specific value or key.
- **Delete After a Node**: Remove the node that comes immediately after a given node.
- **Delete Before a Node**: Remove the node that comes immediately before a given node.

---

### **4. Traversal**
- **Traverse Forward**: Start from the head and move toward the end of the list using the `next` pointer.
- **Traverse Backward**: Start from the last node and move toward the beginning using the `prev` pointer.

---

### **5. Search**
- **Search by Value**: Find the first node that matches a specific value.
- **Search by Index**: Retrieve the node at a specific position.

---

### **6. Update**
- **Update Node Data**: Change the data of a specific node in the list.

---

### **7. Sorting**
- **Sort the List**: Rearrange nodes in ascending or descending order using a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort or insertion sort).

---

### **8. Reverse**
- **Reverse the List**: Reverse the order of the nodes by swapping their `next` and `prev` pointers.

---

### **9. Count**
- **Count Nodes**: Count the total number of nodes in the list.

---

### **10. Merging**
- **Merge Two Lists**: Combine two doubly linked lists into one.

---

### **11. Splitting**
- **Split the List**: Divide the doubly linked list into two separate lists.

---

### **12. Memory Management**
- **Free All Nodes**: Deallocate memory used by all nodes to prevent memory leaks.
