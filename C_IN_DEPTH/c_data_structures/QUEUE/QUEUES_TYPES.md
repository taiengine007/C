Queues are a fundamental data structure used to store and manage collections of data in a particular order. Below are the main types of queues:

---

### **1. Simple Queue (Linear Queue):**
- **Description**: A standard queue where elements are added (enqueued) at the rear and removed (dequeued) from the front.
- **Order**: First In, First Out (FIFO).
- **Operations**: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`, `isFull`.
- **Use Case**: Print job scheduling, call center ticketing.

---

### **2. Circular Queue:**
- **Description**: A queue in which the last position is connected back to the first position, forming a circle.
- **Advantage**: Utilizes space efficiently by reusing previously freed positions.
- **Order**: FIFO, but the queue wraps around.
- **Operations**: Same as Simple Queue but implemented with modulo arithmetic.
- **Use Case**: CPU scheduling, memory management.

---

### **3. Priority Queue:**
- **Description**: A queue where elements are dequeued based on priority, not just insertion order.
- **Types**:
  - **Max-Priority Queue**: Highest priority elements are dequeued first.
  - **Min-Priority Queue**: Lowest priority elements are dequeued first.
- **Order**: Priority-based, not FIFO.
- **Use Case**: Dijkstra's algorithm, task scheduling.

---

### **4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue):**
- **Description**: A queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends.
- **Types**:
  - **Input-Restricted Deque**: Insertions only at one end; deletions at both ends.
  - **Output-Restricted Deque**: Deletions only at one end; insertions at both ends.
- **Use Case**: Palindrome checking, undo operations in text editors.

---

### **5. Concurrent Queue:**
- **Description**: A thread-safe queue that supports concurrent access by multiple threads.
- **Implementation**: Often uses locking mechanisms or lock-free algorithms.
- **Use Case**: Multi-threaded applications, message passing systems.

---

### **6. Double Priority Queue:**
- **Description**: A priority queue where both the highest and lowest priority elements can be accessed or removed.
- **Order**: Supports access from both ends based on priority.
- **Use Case**: Range-based query processing.

---

### **7. Blocking Queue:**
- **Description**: A queue that blocks operations (like enqueue or dequeue) when the queue is full or empty.
- **Use Case**: Producer-consumer problem, thread synchronization.

---

### **8. Circular Buffer (Ring Buffer):**
- **Description**: A fixed-size buffer that overwrites old data when full.
- **Order**: Oldest data overwritten; FIFO for active data.
- **Use Case**: Audio and video streaming, hardware buffer management.

| **Type**             | **Insertion**        | **Deletion**          | **Use Case**            |
|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Simple Queue          | Rear                | Front                 | Basic operations        |
| Circular Queue        | Rear (Circular)     | Front (Circular)      | Memory management       |
| Priority Queue        | By Priority         | By Priority           | Algorithms, scheduling  |
| Deque                 | Both Ends           | Both Ends             | Undo, palindrome check  |
| Concurrent Queue      | Multi-threaded      | Multi-threaded        | Parallel processing     |
| Blocking Queue        | Blocks if full/empty| Blocks if full/empty  | Producer-consumer       |
